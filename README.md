# fguard-exploit
Kernel heap overflow exploit for fguard.sys

Put FGuard32[64].sys to the directory of the exploit and run.
To build required memory layout the exploit triggers the overflow several times and leverages DRIVER_OBJECT::FastIoDispatch to pass control to the injected code.

Windows 7 only. Tested for 1GB of memory.
